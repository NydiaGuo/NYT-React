# NYT-React
This is a new React-based rendition of the New York Times Article Search application. In this app, I created React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize the React mounting lifecycle to query and display articles based on user searches. I also used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save articles to read later.
